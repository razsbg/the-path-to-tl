# Introduction

## Software architecture consists of
* Structure
* Architecture characteristics
    * Availability
    * Performance
    * Scalability
    * Reliability
    * Security
    * Testability
    * Fault tolerance
    * Elasticity
    * Deployability
    * etc.
* Design principles
* Architecture decisions

## Core expectations placed on a software architect:
* Make architecture decisions
    * An architect is expected to define the architecture decisions and design principles used to guide technology decisions within the team, the department, or across the enterprise.
* Continually analyse the architecture
    * An architect is expected to continually analyse the architecture and current technology environment and then recommend solutions for improvement.
* Keep current with the latest trends
    * An architect is expected to keep current with the latest technology and industry trends.
* Ensure compliance with decisions
    * An architect is expected to ensure compliance with architecture decisions and design principles.
* Diverse exposure & experience
    * An architect is expected to have exposure to multiple and diverse technologies, frameworks, platforms, and environments.
* Have business domain knowledge
    * An architect is expected to have a certain level of business domain expertise.
* Posses interpersonal skills ✅
    * An architect is expected to possess exceptional interpersonal skills, including teamwork, facilitation, and leadership.

## Interesting quotes
* “*… in the early days of the internet, companies had to manage their own infrastructure, and many fell victim to a previously unheard of phenomenon: **too much success can kill the business**.*”
* “*Building Evolutionary Architectures co-opts this idea to create **architectural fitness functions**: an objective integrity assessment of some architectural characteristic(s). This assessment may include a variety of mechanisms, such as metrics, unit tests, monitors, and chaos engineering.*”
* “*Architects in Agile projects can assume **iterative development** and therefore a **faster feedback loop** for decisions. That in turn allows architects to be more aggressive about **experimentation** and other knowledge that relies on feedback.*”

## Laws of Software Architecture
* *Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.* - *First Law of Software Architecture*
  * *If an architect thinks they have discovered something that isn’t a trade- off, more likely they just haven’t identified the trade-off yet.* - Corollary 1
* *Why is more important than how.* - *Second Law of Software Architecture*
